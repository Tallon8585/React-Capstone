        page. you can add products from the home page, products page, and the
        individual product page. You can filter by category on the product page.

        From my time at DevPipeline I have learned that it is ok to fail. There
        have been times throughout the frnt end class where i thought i wasn't
        going to be able to finish this class but i hung in there and now that
        i'm doing this final capstone i can say that i know what it takes to be
        a front end developer and i may not fully enderstand javascript and
        react 100% but i now know enough to were i can breakdown harder problems
        and make them more managable to were i can understand them and finish
        them.

        As of right now my favorite coding language is react because in
        foundations with python all we were doing was printing to the terminal
        but with react i can make the dom do what i want to do and th acutally
        see that is awesone. It's also satisfying when you get something to work
        in react and understand what you're making it do. I also like SASS
        because it makes styling pages a whole lot easier and i just like
        styling as a whole.
